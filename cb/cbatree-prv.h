 * These trees are optimized for adding the minimalest overhead to the stored
 * data. This version uses the node's pointer as the key, for the purpose of
 * quickly finding its neighbours.
 *
 * A few properties :
 * - the xor between two branches of a node cannot be zero unless the two
 *   branches are duplicate keys
 * - the xor between two nodes has *at least* the split bit set, possibly more
 * - the split bit is always strictly smaller for a node than for its parent,
 *   which implies that the xor between the keys of the lowest level node is
 *   always smaller than the xor between a higher level node. Hence the xor
 *   between the branches of a regular leaf is always strictly larger than the
 *   xor of its parent node's branches if this node is different, since the
 *   leaf is associated with a higher level node which has at least one higher
 *   level branch. The first leaf doesn't validate this but is handled by the
 *   rules below.
 * - during the descent, the node corresponding to a leaf is always visited
 *   before the leaf, unless it's the first inserted, nodeless leaf.
 * - the first key is the only one without any node, and it has both its
 *   branches pointing to itself during insertion to detect it (i.e. xor==0).
 * - a leaf is always present as a node on the path from the root, except for
 *   the inserted first key which has no node, and is recognizable by its two
 *   branches pointing to itself.
 * - a consequence of the rules above is that a non-first leaf appearing below
 *   a node will necessarily have an associated node with a split bit equal to
 *   or greater than the node's split bit.
 * - another consequence is that below a node, the split bits are different for
 *   each branches since both of them are already present above the node, thus
 *   at different levels, so their respective XOR values will be different.
 * - since all nodes in a given path have a different split bit, if a leaf has
 *   the same split bit as its parent node, it is necessary its associated leaf
 *
 * When descending along the tree, it is possible to know that a search key is
 * not present, because its XOR with both of the branches is stricly higher
 * than the inter-branch XOR. The reason is simple : the inter-branch XOR will
 * have its highest bit set indicating the split bit. Since it's the bit that
 * differs between the two branches, the key cannot have it both set and
 * cleared when comparing to the branch values. So xoring the key with both
 * branches will emit a higher bit only when the key's bit differs from both
 * branches' similar bit. Thus, the following equation :
 *      (XOR(key, L) > XOR(L, R)) && (XOR(key, R) > XOR(L, R))
 * is only true when the key should be placed above that node. Since the key
 * has a higher bit which differs from the node, either it has it set and the
 * node has it clear (same for both branches), or it has it clear and the node
 * has it set for both branches. For this reason it's enough to compare the key
 * with any node when the equation above is true, to know if it ought to be
 * present on the left or on the right side. This is useful for insertion and
 * for range lookups.
